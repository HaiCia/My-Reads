# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. 

## TL;DR

To get started:

* download files from <https://github.com/HaiCia/reactnd-project-myreads-starter>
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* browser should automatically open new window with the app, if not navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

## What You're Getting

You are getting a MyReads app with three categories: 
  1. Currently reading
  2. Want To Read 
  3. Read

You can move existing books around by clicking the green button on the right bottom corner of a cover and change shelves where books belong. To search for new books click the "+" icon on the right bottom side of the browser window, then search by title or author name. 

## Backend Server

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
